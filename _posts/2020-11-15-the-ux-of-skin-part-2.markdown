Following the first presentation to our class, we decided to look into ways of creating an experience exploring the layers of skin that were more meaningful and immersive. Right after the feedbacks, Max and I started sketching a structure that allowed people to physically go through the layers, as in a small corridor. We measured the class and calculated how long the structure could be and what materials could be used to construct it.

As a team, we discussed the ideas we wanted to convey: we wanted to start from darkness to light, and the layers had to have some increasing difficulty followed by an easy path, but the last light should never be reachable. We imagined that, just like in relationships with other people, you had to go through tortuous ways to get as far as possible, as there never is a defined ending.

After defining what we wanted to do, we started thinking of materials. We experimented with some things we already had, seeing how much light could go through, the sounds they made, and how heavy they were. I created a collage to represent how we would arrange them. 



### Experience in class

The day of class was the first time we could put all the layers together since we couldn’t meet before with everything ready due to COVID-19 restrictions. Max was responsible for assembling the structure made of bamboo and PVC, and, Moxue, Giada, and I created the layers.

We asked our colleagues to tell us what they felt when going through the layers. Here are some of their thoughts:

> “I felt like a princess” – Zhaolu

> “It felt like going from winter to spring” – Svaney

Generally, the feedback was positive. Alistair said he particularly liked how we worked with manipulating the users with the architecture. If anything, I wouldn’t have given any explanations to the class of what each layer should represent, and that’s why I won’t provide them here either. It’s up for you to decide what you feel when you go through the layers, which you can in the following video:
