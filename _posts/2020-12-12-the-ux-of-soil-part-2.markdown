Soil preservation, biodiversity and rituals. What do they have in common? Following our feedback round [last week](https://mariaseves.com.br/the-ux-of-soil-part-1/), we decided to unify all the main topics discussed into one idea.

We began by considering the educational aspects of building a terrarium.  I illustrated an image to represent how I envisioned the result could be through the years if one were to use soil from their birthplace and learning about its ecosystem.

Still, we felt that this idea could be developed further to have more impact. Thinking of rituals, we started to wonder if there could be some meaning attached to the terrarium and if this could be supported by a larger group of people. I decided to create a storyboard to illustrate how this new ritual could take place.

With the team's approval, I started a document to define and delimit some aspects of this new ritual. What would this program be called, how would it work, who would be responsible for it, when did it happen, how long, and other details to build this idea into a more tangible product. I also started creating a script for the one minute video we would make, as we thought this could be the best way to quickly illustrate program's purpose.

We researched the impacts the implementation of the Soil Warriors program from birth could have on the upbring and development of children. Creating a routine or ritual helps the vocabulary and social development (Spagnola, M. and Fiese, B.H. (2007))., while caring for plants makes them more empathetic to the world around us (Wilson, R. (2014)). It’s also important to observe that ecological literacy, i.e. the understanding of the ecological world that supports life on earth, is deemed essential for the survival of humanity (Capra, F. (2009)). 

#### Preparing the project

The plan for our class presentation was to award each student a kit for our new soil program, the Soil Warriors. I was responsible for finding the compartments and fill them with the soil our class would receive.

Qendressa edited the promotional video for our package. Max and Svaney worked on creating a [certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qpN9w5BLrYwK3cdK0i4JsanFb_WHKPmu/view?usp=sharing) and [handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cDYJPHRedDxS8um0G37JB6JXAUtFhlE3/view?usp=sharing) that would be given out with the soil box, adapting the text we previously wrote with all the program details.

#### Presentation and feedback

The video was played for all the class, and we proceeded to call each student to receive their soil package. They were also invited to plant some seeds and start caring for their soil right away.

For feedback, we were encouraged to think of even more aspects of this program, such as how to ensure that people would follow it through, and a wish that the video was made with real photos instead of icons and vectors. What students loved was to receive seeds and start planting right away, and some even sent me pictures a few days later showing the evolution of their plants. This may be a sign that with the right structure, an adaptation of this program could be implemented some day.
