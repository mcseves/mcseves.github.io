Soil is the foundation of our lives. We come from it, and we end our term as a part of it. To kick off this brief, I started a research on the different roles of soil: its cultural aspects, its colours and usages through time.

#### AEIOU

To explore and understand how people interact with soil, we went to Hyde Park, London, where we wandered around observing people through AEIOU research method. As we explored, we passed through a group of volunteers who were tending a garden. The Royal Garden crew was keeping the space, removing bamboo roots that were destroying the pavement. I made a document with what I witnessed on the scene, and they explained how some of the tools worked and their goal of preparing the area to receive more biodiverse seeds.

Our next stop was the allotment area at Kensington Garden, a spot the volunteers suggested. Even though no one was around, we spotted a coop with chicken. Through little rituals, chicken depend a lot on soil interactions to live: for cleaning and bathing, eating, and even communicating with each other.

#### Speed Dating
After we shared our findings from AEIOU, the team was having a hard time thinking of experiences to draw for our speed dating. I suggested that each of us created two scenarios, and we all shared our images in a Miro document. Both experiences that I drew were about biodiversity. The first prompt is: if the soil is the skin of the earth, what can we learn from each different place? The second prompt proposed art as a way of people connecting and learning about different types of soil.

Then, Qendressa and I held speed date sessions to gather feedback on each scenario. The person I interviewed said he found it interesting to see how soil is an impactful resource that comes back to haunt humans when we mistreat it. He also noted that this exercise helped him reflect on the importance of soil in our daily lives.

#### Sharing in class
For our presentation, we decided to show our AEIOU process and the three most popular ideas. Each one had a different aspect regarding soil: the first would education on different soil types, described previously. The second one considered an exercise of making your terrarium and completing it with things that would damage it, as a way to represent what our real actions are doing to our soil. The third one was the creation of a ritual to reconnect us to soil through eating it.

The class showed a real interest in the educational aspect. One valuable observation was that the terrarium idea would need to be seen through a period to show damage and that we could be bolder when thinking of creating a ritual. Our challenge for [next week](https://mariaseves.com.br/the-ux-of-soil-part-2/) is to evolve this ideas into a proper experience.
