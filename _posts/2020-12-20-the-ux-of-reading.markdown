Brief: Design an experience that reveals what happens when we read

Reading is present in many parts of our daily routines, so ingrained that we do without even paying attention. From the news feed to nutritional values in boxes, receipts, and medicine leaflets, every day we are required to process information.

As of 2020, there has never been a year in the age of mobile whereas many news were daily reported, with a pandemic surrounded by the economic and politic crisis in every part of the globe. This year we were required to digest a lot of information, and many times we can't fully grasp what is written as it is explained by using really large numbers. By large numbers, I mean millions and trillions, which humans have a hard time understanding (Landy, D., Silbert, N. and Goldin, A. (2013)).

In this project, we explore how people understand and visualize really large numbers.

#### Literature Review

For our Lit Review, we wanted to explore the confusion and anxiety that reading can cause. I read two that explored mathematics anxiety and understanding of large numbers.

In "Estimating Large Numbers", the authors concluded that even though people may have a comprehension of how to manipulate large numbers, most cannot still abstract from them and visualize these sums. In “Mathematics Anxiety” one of the most important findings is that the anxiety towards math has negative impacts on the attitude the affected individuals have towards the subject and any activity relating to it. 

We created a mind map illustrating the key findings of our readings.

#### Interview and test

Investigating how other people deal with large numbers and to test our idea for a prototype, we decided to ask people to draw how they understood a news report on COVID 19 infection numbers. My interviewer immediately decided to draw a graph bar, and as he works with numbers he reportedly didn’t need a lot of time to understand the information

#### Prototype and class experience

For our prototype, we held a workshop on visualizing data. We selected three reports in current subjects: sea pollution, COVID 19 vaccination, and obesity rates in the UK. For each news, there was a bag of related items that could be used to create a piece of visual information for the numbers read. COVID received a bag of medical items, obesity received fast food and candy, and sea pollution had a bag filled with trash.

The class was divided into three groups and produced their visual understanding of the news. As I was remote, I couldn’t participate during the activity. 

#### Feedback
One group of students found the news too difficult for the given time frame. In general, they liked the activity and felt that the chosen theme is relevant, as they identified with the difficulty of digesting information.
