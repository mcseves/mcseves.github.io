> Brief: Design a way to express the skin/world interface

The skin shouldn't be simply remembered as the largest organ that protects our bodies. Anthropology, art, history, literature, philosophy, and sociology are some of the fields that research the different aspects of skin. Presented with this facts, the challenge was to create a prototype for the skin/world interface.

Before holding our first meeting, our group decided it would be relevant to do some individual research. I was pretty interested in the ways we use our skin to express ourselves and how different cultures use their bodies to portray information about identity and culture.

We then host our first meeting, in which we made a mind map of the different topics that called our attention. From this first meeting, two ideas came forward for us to work on during the week:



## Skin of the city

Starting with the idea of walls being the skin of cities, we started questioning if we could represent the different cultural aspects somewhere, as its intangible skin. We wanted it to be interactable and have different textures and patterns, as we’ve seen in many tribes that do scarification.

As a result, Giada and Moxue created some prototypes. The first was the city of London represented as a rainy day drawn on tin foil since it sounds like the water is dropping as it moves. The second was two cubes made with a modeling material and different dry grains where each one had a different pattern representing a particular culture from a country. 


##	Skin of privacy

As we discussed the idea of skin being a barrier, the topic of private life came to mind. Humans have many layers, and we filter our social relationships according to how much of our privacy we want to share. From a scientific point of view, the skin also has many layers with different functions. We associated the two ideas and decided it would be interesting to explore the layers of skin and relationships.

To represent this, we created a vertical structure filled with materials with different porosities: paper that was waterproofed with clear nail polish and with different-sized holes, a sponge, and a coffee filter. 
To demonstrate how humans let different things get through them, we experimented with dry grains and water to analyze the efficiency of each to go through the layers.

During class, we showcased all our prototypes to help us decide what direction we should explore more, and the one that sparked the most interest was the one of privacy. For feedback, the recommendation was to think about scaling the prototype and not letting it be too literal and to think more about the materials we wanted to use and what we wanted to let go through it. 

The feedback given resulted in a change of direction that you can find [in my next post]({% post_url 2020-11-15-the-ux-of-skin-part-2 %}).
