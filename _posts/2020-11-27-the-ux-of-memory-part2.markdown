<p class="about-content-box"> <br> Brief: Design an experience the externalises the nature of memory
<BR>Team: Damul Yang, Maria Carolina Séves, Qendressa Selimi, Sebastian Ervi <br><br></p>

How can we experience music together again? After our last presentation, we received the challenge of activating memories through music with a crowd from drastically different backgrounds and cultures.

#### Developing our idea

The team came with several new approaches. I proposed we developed an experience of recognizing sounds, where we would survey the most 'memorable' ones and create a listening experience. Ultimately, we decided to pursue another route.

Sebastian proposed the idea we eventually settled in, based on the notion that relevant music can evoke memories. We began by creating a form asking our classmates to list two songs that fit into that criteria and transforming the answers into a YouTube playlist. The memories recalled should be drawn into a structured map provided by our team.



To test the experience, Sebastian and me held at an online session with three people. Each participant picked a song from the list and was encouraged to draw whatever came to their mind. The result was better than we anticipated, as each was able to fill the entire paper with drawings and remarks. One of the participants said that they even wished there was more space to draw. Discussing our findings with the rest of the team, we decided to change the drawing map's structure to allow more room for thought. 

To allow our classmates to obtain our playlist, Qendressa created an app prototype, made accessible via QR code. 

Adding togetherness to our experience, I suggested that we created a web of musical memories, in the form of a board with pins. Connecting similar occurrences with a thread, we would have a structure that resembled the memory storage in our brains, and we could invite students to interact and share their ideas.


#### The experience

We explained the experiment and handed out papers for everyone to draw on. After 5 minutes, we got them back and pinned them on our board. Individually, some peers shared their music of choice and related memories attached to it, linking with the next person who felt personally related to the story and decided to share. The final result was a significant cobweb of musical memories.

#### Feedbacks
Even though our test exceeded expectations, the real experience lacked coordination and planning. The different environmental conditions and the higher number of participants resulted in a rushed event, with some relating they needed more opportunity to think and draw. Praising the sharing section, some of the peers felt our focus could have been on the confraternization.

If we were to redo this experiment, I would have asked our class to do the listening and drawing activities previously.  Our in-person experience time would be dedicated to sharing and creating our memory board artefact.
