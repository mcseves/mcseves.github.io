On our first assignment, we were invited to explore London while sensing togetherness. Amidst a pandemic, where we are deprived of close contact with other human beings, how can we connect?

## First task
Our meeting point was right in front of a coffee place called Anfa Café at Farringdon, a small district in Central London. Standing there, we found ourselves looking for ways to complete our first task, inspired by children playing carefreely exploring all their senses. This was the result:

* **Sight:** wearing blue, crowns and beanies, and sporting some handmade face masks personalized with the four suits of a deck of cards, we placed ourselves on each side of the crossing road, the farthest way we could be where we could still see each other. Together, we synchronized a wave just like people do on game night at stadiums, keeping in sight the movement of each other. 

* **Sound:** I suggested we clapped our hands from a distance, and the sound reverberated through the street.

* **Smell:** using two perfumes provided by Damul and Maria S., we divided into pairs, we tried to identify which perfume was being presented to us

 
* **Taste:** Sebastian volunteered to bring typical Finnish sweets for the group, letting us know beforehand that it wouldn’t be like any other candy we had ever had. Closing our eyes to enhance the experience, Damul, Maria, and I tasted at the same time a piece of Salmiakki.


* **Touch:** We experimented with touch in a COVID-friendly way: we all held different parts of a long string, pulled and waving it to be acknowledged. 


## Second task

Our second task for the day was even more challenging: could we still connect while using other senses? We decided to explore a bit more of the area, and these are the experiments we did:

* **Proprioception:** for the perception of position, we did my favourite investigation. Using a childhood game from my home country called futpano, we used a clean sheet that I brought and something to throw around. Dividing into pairs, we each held to an end of this sheet and tried to make a goal on our adversary. On some rounds, we even played with our eyes closed.
We also explored this sense with a game suggested by Damul, where we spun in place with closed eyes and then had to find each other.

* **Balance:** in a park, Maria S. suggested we should walk across a bench with closed eyes while holding a string. To help with guidance, there would be two people on each end of the string vibrating it to indicate the right way. We also found a playground where we were able to test our balance.

* **Temperature:** we all took turns sitting on the same bench, which was heated by the last person seating. In this way, we knew that someone else was there without actually getting in close contact.

## Outcomes
For each of our experiments, our togetherness rose through the sharing of experiences. Even though it was much easier to keep in contact during the first task round, we managed to create a different type of connection when relying on other senses and when we let ourselves to be more playful and have fun.
