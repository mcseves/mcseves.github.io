  <p><strong>Brief:</strong> Design an experience that manipulates human senses</p>

<p>Following our <a href="/starting-the-year/">London exploration</a>, our next task was to create an experience for our classmates based on the happenings we thought made us feel the most connected and thus gave us the most sense of communion.</p>

<p>Relieving our last meeting, the team concluded that we felt the closest when we shared sensations, feelings, and where interactions depended on the trust in one another.  As it is natural for humans, the act of having lunch together and sharing a cup of coffee made us feel familiar and was one of the highlights we chose.  Another was the experience of crossing a bench with closed eyes trusting in our senses of balance, proprioception, and that our colleague would not let us get too close to the edge.</p>

  <li><strong>The Coffee Shop</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Our coffee shop experience revolved around the idea of sharing a cup of warm coffee. One of our teammates would work as a barista, and the whole class would get one cup, enjoying the smell of freshly brewed beans. We would put some coffee shop background sounds and stimulate the classroom to have a chitchat about the weather, our families, and their stay in London.</p>

  <li><strong>The Funfair</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While exploring the district of Farringdon, we ended up in a secluded park, where we created the bench experiment. We thought it would be fun to walk across a bench with closed eyes while holding a string and sensing the vibration to choose which direction to go. This experience was the chosen one to be exhibited.</p>

<p>To recreate this in our classroom environment and help everyone establish a connection, we concluded it would be interesting to stimulate all of our senses.</p>

<p>We chose to create a circuit, using tape on the floor to mark where the park customer would need to follow. The catch? The person had to close their eyes and follow the vibrations while avoiding the dangerous zones marked on the floor, which the crowd would let them know if they got closer by booing and clapping. We put music from an amusement park playing in the background and distributed colorful candy for all the class. Everyone received an invitation to interact and cheer for the participant. And our group decided to go characterized: Sebastian and I went dressed in bright colors since we were the hosts, and Maria S. and Damul were all in black to fade into the background as the ones who would be controlling the circuit. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the roles had to be changed when we presented.</p>

  <li><strong>Results</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The class had a lot of fun, and we received feedback that it was enjoyable that we encouraged everyone to participate. If anything, we would have practiced more the welcoming speech, and tweaked the circuit a little to give it more of a funfair feel.</p>
