<p>How is music related to memory? Music and sounds can evoke different emotions and recollections. This week, we decided to explore how people relate music to their life experiences.</p>

<h4 id="artefact-analysis">Artefact Analysis</h4>

<p>For our artefact analysis, we decided to investigate two categories of items related to music: the ones that produce music (microphone and guitar), and the ones we use to consume it, like Airpods, iPod Nano, and CDs. Some of the things we noticed were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microphones and guitars have a stronger connection with sharing music, being used, for example, to sing at karaoke and playing with friends.</li>
  <li>The CD is the predecessor of the iPod Nano, which was already replaced by other newer forms of enjoying music. With each passing new music player, we get more ways of enjoying music individually.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="directed-storytelling">Directed Storytelling</h4>

<p>Realizing that the timelines of our musical artefacts showed different behaviour in consuming music, it was essential to interview people from different generations. The youngest person interviewed was 11 years old, and the oldest was 64 years old. We interviewed a total of 10 persons, and the prompt was: <strong>tell me a story about a strong memory related to music</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the interviewers said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each route you passed through in Pok√©mon had a different theme. I played it so much, and with such happiness that the sounds are ingrained in my brain. I feel a lot of nostalgia about this time, and Pok√©mon was something I shared with all my friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We summarized the interviews in keywords and clustered them into themes. Our most relevant finding was that the strongest memories are related to sharing moments with friends and family, with music in the background.</p>

<h4 id="research-findings">Research findings</h4>

<p>The results of our Artefact Analysis and Directed Storytelling had conflicting conclusions. Music is made each passing day to be enjoyed in private and personalized for one‚Äôs tastes, and the strongest memories are related to feeling togetherness. The essential question is <strong>how can we experience music together again?</strong>.</p>

<p>With a quick brainstorm, we came up with a few ideas involving songs and sounds:</p>

<div width="100%" align="center">

<ul>
  <li><strong>What if we throw a party?</strong> With a jukebox, CDs, and video clips, we would ask one of our classmates to pick a song from the 2000s to play in the jukebox and ask everyone to dance.</li>
  <li><strong>What do you associate this sound with?</strong> We would record different sounds that could represent stories according to the order played, asking the class to register what activity the sounds reminded them about.</li>
  <li><strong>What do you think of when the alarm goes off?</strong> We would put different alarms playing, and ask the class to register the memories they had when listening to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>After presenting these ideas to the class, we had positive reactions to the idea of exploring memories triggered by sounds. Our goal for next week is to work more on our ideas and test them to see if they achieve our desired goal.</p>
